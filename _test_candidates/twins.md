Julius and Vincent Benedict are the results of an experiment that would allow for the perfect child.

Julius was planned and grows to athletic proportions.

Vincent is an accident and is somewhat smaller in stature.

Vincent is placed in an orphanage while Julius is taken to a South Seas island and raised by philosophers.

Vincent becomes the ultimate lowlife and is about to be killed by loan sharks when Julius discovers that he has a brother and begins looking for him.
