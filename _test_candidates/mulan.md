The Fa family's only child, tomboy Mulan, fails to fulfill a Chinese girl's traditional duty as desirable bride.

When the empire mobilizes a man from every family to fight the invading Huns, Mulan fears her father, an honorable veteran, is no longer up to fighting and joins in his place, masquerading as fictitious son Fa Ping.

The ancestors designate the mighty stone dragon as her magical protector, but only eager baby-dragon Mushu actually goes. Ping is assigned to general Li son captain Fa Li's training unit. He does an amazing job preparing the peasant recruits, yet only Mushu and the luck cricket grandma gave Mulan overturn the mandarin adviser's negative report.

When the reach the front, the Huns have already wiped out the regular army. Now the novice company must save China or perish honorably.
