Hi! My name is Aaron Browne and I’m excited for the opportunity to play a part in the future of Polydelphia! I’ve been a member since I started identifying as polyamorous 3 years ago. I met all of my current partners and have gained many really good friendships through my participation in this community. It is an incredibly valuable part of my life.

A little bit about me: when I’m not helping my partners throw social gatherings for Polydelphia, I earn my keep as a computer programmer at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I also volunteer with two social justice organizations: If Not Now and SURJ. I strive to understand the way oppression works in society and in myself and am deeply invested in eradicating it through conscious community building. I work hard to be better at communicating my own needs and hearing the needs of others.

The best thing about Polydelphia is its members. I feel blessed to spend time with people who create their own definition of love. But, as a group, we’ve struggled to create a community that feels inclusive and safe for everyone. As a white mostly heterosexual man, I want to help amplify the voices of those who don’t feel included or safe and be a part of changing our community so that they do. I believe that while we are creating our own definition of love, we can and should also create our own definition of community.
