My name is Ulysses Grant Slaughter, Jr. Within a small circle of friends and family, I am know as "Butch." I would be honored to serve on the steering committee for Polydelphia. My personal life, my passion for polyamorous expression and my deep experience in international "sex positive" communities uniquely qualifies me for service to those exploring and living in this beautiful and delicate space of human connection. I am creator of the concept "Sex In The Struggle" a multi-faceted intimacy experience advocating "social healing through sexual healing." This emerging concept was born out of my relationship with my parents who consistently struggled for shared intimacy but ultimately created a family tragedy when my father shot and killed my mother when I was 12 years old. Their social-sexual tension informs me every day of my life.

My most recent and deep experience in the world of polyamory came between the years of 2013 and 2016 when I created The OneTaste Orgasmic Reconciliation Council for Nicole Daedone and OneTaste Incorporated. As chief architect of The "OM" Reconciliation Council, I led an international team of community volunteers that established "user friendly" conflict resolution protocols, workshops and operation manuals for members who were exploring kink, taboo, polyamory and "extreme" sexual sensation. My community contribution spanned from Sydney, Australia to San Francisco with many countries and cities between. In my time with the company, I consulted staff and members on legal matters, public relations issue, sustainable community development, online community forums and cultural considerations.

Polyamorous by nature, I have explored ethical, non-monogamous relationships for more than two decades. My experience, both personal and professional shows me that quantity of exploration doesn't speak to quality of exploration. In this delicate realm of human connection, I am certain that humility is a - if not "the" - key factor that supports authentic and transparent ethical non-monogamous living. I welcome the opportunity to serve Polydelphia.
