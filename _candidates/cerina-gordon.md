My name's Cerina, I use she/her pronouns. I've been a part of this group since last summer(?), and am admittedly not all that active in the discussions. If you attend in-person events in the Philadelphia area you may have met me at something related to polyamory, queerness, kink or paganism. I've been practicing polyamory for the past year-and-a-half-ish and still have really no idea what I'm doing, but everyone involved seems to be happy, so I figure I must be doing something right. 

Since there has been a call for POC applicants, I will also mention that I'm half Filipino, but I am /very/ white-passing and where Filipinos fall in terms of most issues affecting POC communities is pretty ??? (Filipinos: they probably exist), so make what you will of that.

In terms of where I would like to see this group going, I think this group should largely function as a learning environment for people who are new to polyamory and a safe, friendly community for people who are lacking a polyamory-friendly community in their personal lives. To that end, I largely see the job of admin as being about discussion moderation and conflict mediation/resolution. As an admin, those are the goals I would like to support and the duties I would like to perform. I would also be happy to run or participate in various educational workshops if people would like to have any particular workshops; I can talk pretty extensively about most of the communities I mentioned in my "about" section.
