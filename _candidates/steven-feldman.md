I'm a mostly life-long resident of Philadelphia (currently south). I'm a father to an almost 4yr old boy, spouse to my partner of almost 10 years, and have another partner of 6 months. I'm in nonprofit management with an IS/IT focus, and just came off of running IT for Clinton's campaign in Pennsylvania. A nerd of all trades, my current foci are civic planning, political discourse, policy, board gaming, and (of course) navigating this polyamory lifestyle.

All of those things inform why I'm interested in helping steer. I love this city and want to participate in building/improving its equity and social structures - and the national campaign work has renewed my preference for a focus on the local. With many years of service & training in productive board service, committee/board work is the sort of volunteerism where I feel most productive. Similarly, as a patient & diplomatic person, I enjoy the process of contributing ideas and effort into a larger whole that is only partially mine. As a parent and relative newcomer to polyamory, I want to build towards broad normalization of our lifestyle. Finally, as an egalitarian who acknowledges the privileges I enjoy as a white, hetero (ish), educated, english-speaking, married, middle income, cis-gendered male, I have a severe interest in flattening the hills & filling the valleys.
