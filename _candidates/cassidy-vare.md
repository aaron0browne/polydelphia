Who am I?

I'm Cassidy, he/him. To paraphrase the fantastic Kevin Patterson, I'm white, male, heterosexual, cisgender, neurotypical, educated, fairly wealthy and... devastatingly attractive. I've been a member of Polydelphia for about a year, and practicing polyamory for a year and a half. I come from a strongly solo-poly/personal-autonomy perspective. I'm also coming here from the POV of a parent. My two kids are learning about what relationships look like, which means I spend a lot of time thinking about what lessons I want them to learn. 

Why do I want to run away and join the circus (steering committee)?

I'm super grateful to have found this community when I did. I've gotten a lot of support here during the course of defining my polyamory. If there were ever a year when I needed to feel like what I wanted my life to look like was OK, this was that year. I've really enjoyed finding ways to reach out to other people who are navigating the same waters. 

What do I have to offer?

I love doing diplomacy. I'm interested in finding places of common ground when there's disagreement. I love finding ways people can learn from each other, and from situations. I'd like to think I'm insightful, and incisive. 

Also: my demographic slice comes with a lot of privilege. I have a lot going for me. And I've watched a lot of folks who look like me do a lot of talking over, and not a lot of listening to, a lot of people who don't look like me. I want to help the voices and ideas flow both ways. I want to remind the people closest to the mic that we don't have all the answers, even to our own questions, let alone everyone else's.
