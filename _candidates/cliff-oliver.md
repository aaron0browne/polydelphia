I was born and raised in Delaware County, Pennsylvania and am mostly the proud product of a public education. I graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a B.A. and have been working for various nonprofits for the last decade.

I want to join the Polydelphia Steering Committee because I've been ethically non-monogamous for thirteen years and have never found a community as open and supporting of that decision as Polydelphia. I want to give back to the group, and serving on the steering committee seems like a perfect way to do so.
