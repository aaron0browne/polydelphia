Hey all! My name is Rebecca Hiles and I'm throwing my name into the Goblet of Fire: Steering Committee Edition. I'm 28, a bisexual cis-woman, who has a lot of mental illness diagnoses that inform my identity. I've been practicing non-monogamy for the past 12 years, active in non-monogamous communities for the past 6. I'm currently a social work student at Temple with a focus on working with alt-sex communities. I am also the co-author of the book "It's Called Polyamory: Coming Out About Your Nonmonogamous Relationships". I'd like to be a part of this steering committee because I feel like I have an active voice, a passion for seeing my community succeed, and a lot of experience to share with this community. I'm proud of this community, of what we have become, and I'd like to be a part of navigating it together!
