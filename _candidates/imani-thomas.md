My name is Imani Thomas. I've been hanging around this group for some years now and doing non monogamy type stuff for a few more then that. I'm black, trans, non-binary, do programming and am generally feeling on the verge of overwhelm. 

We all want to show up, we want to learn, we want to inspire and connect with each other. Sometimes that goes wonderfully, sometimes our different perspectives get in the way. I am by no means perfect at resolving this but I will put hearing y'alls perspectives as a primary priority and attempt to help us be able to hear and see each other. 

I think a lot of progress has been made with the current groups of folks, and a lot more progress can be made as long as we focus on what figuring out what [questions we need to be asking instead of growing satisfied collecting answers](http://kiriakakis.net/comics/mused/a-day-at-the-park).

Kevin is going to be a tough act to follow, and I'm not going to try to replicate him. What I am going to do is, with the help of the other committee members and the rest of you folks, try to make this a space where we can keep learning, growing, and laughing together.
