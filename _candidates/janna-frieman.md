Hey all! I'm Janna, and I'm running for one of the steering committee positions. I've been nonmonogamous for about 4 years (nonhierarchical yada yada yada), a member of Polydelphia for 2, and have been throwing events for the group along with my partners for the last year or so. The positive vibes at these events (and the opportunity to meet so many lovely people in real life!) has been energizing and really rewarding, and I'm looking forward to more of that in the future.

I want to be involved in the new structure of this group because, in the course of putting events together, I've run directly into the reasons we could use some more formal support and advanced planning. Figuring out how to create a friendly, low-pressure environment for folks like us to meet and build community sounded easy-- but almost immediately raised all kinds of complex issues of safety, inclusiveness, and accessibility which we're still working to figure out. I'm excited to be part of a team to work through those issues together, and to support other members who want to do dope shit like create polyam-friendly resources and throw joint events with other allied groups. I love the online community here, but personally am interested in cultivating networks of neighbors that know and support each other IRL.

Outside of this nonmonogamy business, I work for a labor union, am an unpaid protester (ha), cook like a motherfucker and try to fight the patriarchy/white supremacy whenever I can in my daily life. I'm a Jew and one of those damn reds. If somebody is making lists, I'm probably on 'em. I love Philadelphia, succulents, Jeff Goldblum, and every show Shonda Rhimes makes (yes, even Private Practice, I know, I know). I reside in the nonmonogamous enclave otherwise known as West Philly. Say hi if you see me around :)
