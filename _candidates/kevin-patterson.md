My name is Kevin Patterson and I've been actively non-monogamous for roughly 15 years. I've been a part of the Philadelphia community for about 3 years. With a background in education and a secondary profession as a poly-activist/educator, I can provide some level of connectivity with other polyamory communities nationwide. This could add to the perspectives and resources that we enjoy in locally.

Thank you for your consideration.
