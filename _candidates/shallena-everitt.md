I'm Shallena, awesome WOC. I am very girly, so I go by she/her. Not originally from PA but I've been here since '96. Turned 41 years young this year. Love to travel, eat, read, shop, host/organize... and meet new people.

I transitioned to poly over 10 yrs ago. Once I started researching, I hit the ground running. Had an almost instant grasp on polyamory from the beginning. Thru education, ups/downs, and experience, I've learned a lot about myself and definitely know this is my lifestyle.

Currently in an open triad. Married to 1 of my partners for 18 yrs. We had a commitment ceremony last year with our other partner. We've all been together for 5 yrs. Big blended family... the 3 of us, 5 kids, & 1 parent live in our household. Plus 2 more sets of parents that live close.

I am currently host B&P Philadelphia. Local chapters are set up thru meetup.com. I have been running the group for about 3 yrs. The group supports and helps people socialize in the tri-state area. I host periodic meetings and get togethers. Meetings have been about poly 101, good communication skills, poly in the media, healthy relationships etc. Get togethers have been an annual bbq, holiday party, dinner, bowling and I try to do a coffee chat during the week for anyone looking to just talk. Recently it's just been more new faces looking to talk, and for support.

I am very open and enjoy promoting polyamory in the media. I've been on a a couple of radio shows, tv show, newspaper article (with Kevin & Antoinette) and interviewed for a book someone is doing research for.
