Hello, my name is Kay B. and I am a queer, polyamorous, cisgender Muslim woman who has been living just outside of Philadelphia about eight months. I've been involved with and attending Polydelphia events for two years now. In my work, I am a case manager and have developed many strengths related to connecting with different personality types and bridging gaps between groups. 

I am interested in joining the Polydelphia steering committee because I want to help this organization learn and grow. I love my community.  I want it to be what the people need, and I want to be there to empower others to express and explore those needs.
