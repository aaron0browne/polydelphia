I'm Michelle. I'm a white queer person who has been practicing non-monogamy for about four years. My way of relating falls somewhere around the "relationship anarchy" category and involves some traditional-looking relationships, some deeply valued friendships, some communal living ideals, some kink, and recently lots of exploration of demi & asexual relationships. As an introvert, my scene is not typically dance parties or bars, but I have often been known to host group dinners, game nights, hiking trips, and house concerts. I've met many of you at board game nights and potlucks at my house in West Philly. 

I'm concerned that Polydelphia has often had a reputation for being a "white, straight" space. But after attending recent Town Hall meetings I'm excited that folks in the group are stepping up to take responsibility for making our space much more welcoming to people of color, queer folks, trans & gender non-conforming people, and others who don't see themselves readily represented in mainstream polya narratives. I'm committed to be a part of making this happen, which I'm sure will mean not only drawing from my own experiences as a queer person but also reaching out and listening to people with identities, stories, and needs different from mine. I get excited about bringing people together in community over food, conversation, music, and other experiences. I believe Polydelphia can be a welcoming and diverse space that provides fun and friendly social events, as well as support and opportunities for growth, to all of us in the polya community.
