About myself:

I'm thirty-six years old, bisexual, currently live in West Philly, and have been involved in various flavors ethical non-monogamy for over fourteen years. When I'm not attending Polydelphia events or spending time with my partners, I'm home brewing, playing with my cats, evangelizing cooperative board games, and planning new tattoos. 

Why I want to be on the committee:

In the two years since I joined Polydelphia, I've been consistently grateful for the support, openness, and willingness to teach (and be taught) in this group. When a community does for me, gives me a place to feel welcome, my instinct is to give back, and I would consider it an honor to be part of the steering committee.
